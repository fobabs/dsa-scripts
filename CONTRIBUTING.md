# Contributing to Data Structures and Algorithms Solutions

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting an issue with the existing solutions
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a new solution to a problem or a fix
- Proposing new problems and solutions

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
